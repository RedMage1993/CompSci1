Assignment #3

Problem Summary
Design an interactive program to read 6 integer values representing a, b, c, d, e, and f, respectively.
The program should compute the values of x and y using Cramer's rule. As output it should display the equations being solved and the solutions for x and y, appropriately labeled.

Required Variables:
(int) a, b, c, d, e, f
(double) x, y

ALGORITHM:
print name, section #, and assignment #

prompt for and read a, b, c for the first equation
prompt for and read d, e, f for the second equation

	// compute x and y using Cramer's rule
	x = (c * e - f * b) / (a * e - d * b);
	y = (a * f - d * c) / (a * e - d * b);

print the original equations after substituting a, b, c, d, e, and f
print the computed values of x and y with labels
